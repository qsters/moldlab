# MoldLab

A slime mold simulation inspired Sebastian Lauges video: [Coding Adventure: Ant and Slime Simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A).

## About this project

This repository is new, but is copied to be a public version of this game. It still includes the ad stuff for the mobile build, but you are welcome to carve that out and make a PR if you'd like to. 

I started creating this in Junior year of High School after seeing Sebastian Lagues video. And ended up releasing it to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2454710/MoldLab/) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moldlab/id6449797910) right as I was graduating from highschool.

## More from me

See my [MoldLab-3D](https://github.com/qsters/moldlab-3d) project for a 3d version of this I coded up in a few months at the end of 2025 as my first C++ project.
